# # Part 2: Player Value Prediction Model
#
# In this notebook, we will build a machine learning model to predict a player's auction value based on their performance metrics.
# This will involve:
# 1. Loading and preparing the data.
# 2. Selecting features (Feature Engineering).
# 3. Choosing, training, and evaluating several ML models.
# 4. Comparing the models to find the best performer.
